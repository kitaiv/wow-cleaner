              <p>
                The Company takes all possible measures to exclude or delete all
                data that attempts to directly identify a person from the
                Personal Data we use:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In situations involving free versions, such exclusion or
                  removal of identifiers starts from the point of initial
                  activation of the products. Speaking of paying users, we store
                  Billing Data in a separate database and reduce its use solely
                  for payment processing and our own financial matters.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Meaning both paid and free versions, the company regularly
                  monitors, minimizes, excludes and deletes all data that
                  attempts to identify a person during the normal operation of
                  products and services.
                </li>

              <p>
                The Company displays your Personal Data within our group, our
                partners, service providers who process data on behalf of the
                Company, and government authorities in accordance with
                applicable laws. The processing takes place solely for the
                purposes noted in the current Privacy Policy and the relevant
                sections of the Product Policy. When we disclose your Personal
                Information, we require recipients to follow applicable privacy
                and security practices.

              <h3>How We Protect Your Personal Data</h3>
              <p>
                To ensure the protection of your Personal Data, the Company
                implements administrative, technical and physical security
                measures.

              <h3>Administrative Security Measures</h3>
              <p>
                As a rule, permission to view your Personal Data is limited to
                authorized employees who have a legitimate need for it by virtue
                of their job authority, such as employees who provide technical
                support to end users or maintain user accounts. Similar
                requirements apply to third party contractors that process
                personal information on behalf of the company. The named third
                parties are united by the articles of the confidentiality
                agreement even after the termination of the contractual
                relationship with them. When an individual employee no longer
                needs access, that person's access authorization is
                automatically revoked.

              <h3>Technical security measures</h3>
              <p>
                The Company controls and stores your personal information in the
                database, applying the protection measures described above. In
                addition, we use a state-of-the-art firewall as an innovative
                method of protection, thus providing an additional layer of
                security. We use new anti-virus and malware removal programs and
                are constantly improving our virus programs. Third parties who
                are on staff to provide the services and who have access to our
                users' data must comply with the privacy and security measures
                that the company has established.

              <h3>Physical security measures</h3>
              <p>
                Accessing user information over the network in our database
                requires the use of an encrypted VPN, except when using email
                and disk, which require user authentication keys. Otherwise,
                access will only be available from within our physical premises.
                Physical deletion of Personal Data in our storage facilities is
                prohibited. Third party contractors that process users' personal
                information on behalf of the company are required to maintain
                the required physical security measures.

              <h3>How long do we keep your Personal Data</h3>
              <p>
                The process of storing Users' Personal Data in the database
                operates during the following stages:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  In the case of Billing Data, as long as the company has a
                  legal obligation or a legitimate interest in securing the

                  account;
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the case of Product Data, strictly as needed for tasks
                  related to a specific product or service. The Company applies
                  sliding deletion periods, which means that we regularly delete
                  the collected data at set periods, starting from the time the
                  relevant data was collected. The specified sliding periods for
                  the deletion of Personal Data do not exceed six years. You can
                  learn about the specific rolling removal periods for each of
                  our products and their purposes by referring to our Product
                  Policy.
